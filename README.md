#ECOgnize

Using  machine learning, ECOgnize compares images of plants and animals from multiple APIs to help conservationists better identify them. This technology greatly assists the conservation community by cutting down unnecessary time spent trying to analyze data. 

ECOgnize brings together Google Vision, Amazon Recognition, and Microsoft Azure to better identify camera trap images in the wild. Â
